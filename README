SCRIP_COAWST Wrapper Files
1. constants.f*--> common constants
2. iounits.f* --> IO 
3. kind_mod.f*--> declares different variable kinds
4. scripwrap_mod.f --> declares all the global variables for SCRIP COAWST
5. read_roms.f --> read ROMS grids - rho, psi and masking values
6. read_swan.f --> read SWAN grids - rho, psi and masking values
7. read_wrf.f --> read WRF grids - rho, psi and masking values
8. create_masks.f --> Assigns masking for each model and calls SCRIP Package routines   

Input file
   - "input_file"

Compiling the code: 
   - "make clean"
   - "make" 

Running the code: 
   - Executable created ./scrip
    
Notes:
    - * refers to Fortran files that were part of original SCRIP Package
    - **refers to Fortran files edited from original SCRIP Package 
    - Currently maximum number of grids allocated to "5" for each ROMS, WRF, SWAN code
    - This can be changed in scripwrap_mod.f to any number
